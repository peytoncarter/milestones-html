  <p>Hi, my name is Peyton, and this is my HTML milestones page. This is my website for all my resources and examples about HTML and CSS
    stuff that I have learned so far in the past week. I can come back here and look at it if I need some help or start struggling on how
    to do something later down the line.

  <h2 id="head2">About Me</h2>

<section id="body1">
  <p>I am 19 years old and go to Davidson College. I don't know for sure what I am gonna major in, but it is probably either going to be
    Economics or Political Science. I also play basketball for Davidson.
  </p>

  <p> I like Davidson a lot. The campus is really pretty and the people are super nice. My favorite place to eat and hangout
    on campus is Union.
