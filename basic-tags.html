  <p>This quote is from the opening moments of one of my favorite songs by J. Cole, Crooked Smile:</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://genius.com/J-cole-crooked-smile-lyrics">
    <pre>
    I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
    On my way, on my way, on my way down
    You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
    But like the sun know you know I found my way back round
  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I used the 'pre' tag in the quote above to put the breaks in my lines. It also put the VS code font on there too.</p>
